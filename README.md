# RPA---UIPath-Studio
Robotic Process automation which is the future of simplifying tasks is an underrated service.
So in the given Resume Builder using RPA, you need to download the whole project as it is and renmae the file with extension of .jpg and add in your photo there. Open up the excel file with name `Resume_data.xlsx` and update all the information to your personal information. 
Open up UIPath Studio and open up the project file using Restore dependencies and run the project file, you should see the `resume_template.docx` open up and update itself. 
At the end, a pdf will be stored in the main directory named as Final Resume. You can check out the Demo Resume created.
Cheers.
